# Gene Characteristics Identifier (Fork)

## About This Project
This project is a small AI-powered gene information assistant.

A user can enter a gene symbol (for example, **BRCA1** or **TP53**), and the application:
1. Retrieves the official gene data from NCBI
2. Uses an AI model to convert that data into a concise, clinical-style explanation that is easy to read and understand

The goal is to bridge the gap between raw biological databases and human-readable summaries.

## Motivation
Gene databases like NCBI are extremely powerful, but they are not optimized for quick interpretation. Information is often spread across multiple pages, and the descriptions can be dense and technical.

For clinicians, students, or researchers who just want a fast, high-level overview of a gene, this creates unnecessary friction.

This project was built to reduce that friction by combining:
- Authoritative gene data from NCBI
- Clear, plain-language summarization generated by an AI model

## What the User Sees
From a user’s perspective, the workflow is simple:

- The user lands on a clean web page with a search box
- They enter a gene symbol (e.g. **BRCA1**, **TP53**) or select an example
- The app validates the input to catch invalid or non-existent gene symbols early

If the search succeeds, the results page displays everything in one place:
- Official gene name and gene ID
- Chromosome and genomic location
- Known aliases
- An AI-generated explanation describing:
  - The gene’s function
  - Why it matters clinically
  - Major disease associations

Instead of navigating multiple NCBI pages, the user gets a single summarized view.

## How the Backend Works
The backend follows a straightforward, deterministic pipeline:

1. The user submits a gene symbol from the frontend
2. A Flask backend queries NCBI’s E-utilities API:
   - **eSearch** is used to resolve the gene symbol to a gene ID
   - **eSummary** retrieves structured gene details
3. Relevant fields are extracted, including:
   - Official gene name
   - Description
   - Chromosome and cytogenetic location
   - Aliases
4. This data is cleaned and organized into a structured JSON object
5. The JSON is sent to the **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5 API** with a prompt requesting a short, clinically oriented explanation in plain language
6. Claude returns a concise summary of gene function and disease relevance
7. Flask returns both the structured gene data and the AI summary to the frontend, which renders the results

In short:

**Deterministic database retrieval + generative AI summarization**

## Tech Stack and My Contributions
**Backend**
- Python
- Flask
- NCBI E-utilities (eSearch, eSummary)
- Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5 API

**Frontend**
- HTML
- CSS
- Modern JavaScript

**My Role**
- Helped design the Flask routes and overall data flow
- Integrated NCBI E-utilities and handled JSON parsing
- Integrated the Claude Sonnet 3.5 API for summarization
- Implemented input validation and error handling for invalid gene symbols
- Ensured consistent JSON structure between the database layer and the AI model for reliable summaries
