What this means:

from flask import = "Hey Python, go get me some tools from the Flask toolbox"
Flask = The main tool to create a web server (like a waiter at a restaurant that takes orders)
request = A tool to READ what someone is asking for (like reading an order)
jsonify = A tool to package data nicely to send back (like wrapping food in a box)


CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (fancy name!)
Simple explanation: This lets your website (frontend) talk to your server (backend) without the browser blocking it


requests = A tool to fetch data from the internet
